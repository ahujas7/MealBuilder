The function 'get_element_by_class_name' only works for a single class

Example: 

'product-name__item--name' will work

'product-name__item product-name__item--brand' will throw an exception 
since this class comprises of two separate classes: 'product-name__item' and 'product-name__item--brand'

We should only be using one class as a parameter (the most specific sub-class)
