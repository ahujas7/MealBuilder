Even though the source code exists in the HTML files, the webdriver still needs to 'see'
the element displayed in the browser window to interact with it.

Example: 

The nutrition facts are hidden under an accordion type list
The source code for the nutrition facts exists, but it isn't visible
on the page, hence the webdriver isn't able to retrieve the data.

Rule of thumb: Always see the website from a perspective of a human.
If a human can't see something on the webpage, the webdriver can't see it either.
